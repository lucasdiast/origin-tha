# Origin Frontend Take-Home Assignment

Hi!

Being honest, i don't use typescript daily, but i liked learning during the development process and would love a feedback.

# Things i consider during the development

Why format only on blur?
In my opinion, the use of placeholder + onBlur is more UX friendly then make the user click at the correct place on "0.0"

# Usage

This project requires the latest LTS version of NodeJS and you may need to install the yarn as global dependency

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

After you have cloned this repo and install the yarn, install the dependencies with:

```
yarn install
```

You can then start the application running:

```
yarn start
```

That's it. Just Access `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

### Linting and Format

```
yarn lint
yarn format
```

### Testing

```
yarn test
```
